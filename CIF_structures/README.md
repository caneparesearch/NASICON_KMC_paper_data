Initial input structures for kinetic Monte Carlo from canonical Monte Carlo simulation
Files are in CIF format
File names are in [x]_[structure_index].cif where "x" is defined in Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (x = 0 to 3)
50 structures are taken at each composition x and each of them has an index of "structure_index"
